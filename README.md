This project is a responsive single-page web application developed as a final capstone project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application demonstrates core front-end development skills, including structured layout design, dynamic content rendering, and user interaction handling.

The project features a clean and modern UI with a navigation bar, multiple content sections (About, Projects, Contact), and a dynamic projects section populated using JavaScript. Cards are generated programmatically to display project details, showcasing DOM manipulation and reusable components.

Key optimizations include responsive design using CSS media queries, performance enhancements such as lazy-loaded images, and modular JavaScript for maintainability. Interactive elements like buttons and hover effects improve user experience while maintaining cross-browser compatibility.

This capstone project reflects the ability to build optimized, scalable, and user-friendly web applications, making it suitable as a foundation for portfolios, internships, and entry-level front-end development roles.
